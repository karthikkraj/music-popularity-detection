# 🎵 Music Popularity Detection using Regression

This project aims to **predict the popularity of songs** based on their acoustic and musical features using various regression techniques. By modeling the relationship between song characteristics and their popularity scores, we help music producers, artists, and marketers make **data-driven decisions**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a regression-based machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song using its musical attributes such as:

- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence
- Loudness
- Duration
- Key
- Mode
- Time Signature

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains **227 songs**, each described by:

- **Musical Features** (float values like `acousticness`, `energy`, etc.)
- **Metadata** (`key`, `mode`, `time_signature`)
- **Target Variable**: `popularity` (numeric value ranging from 0 to 100)

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing/null values
   - Removed outliers
   - Feature scaling using StandardScaler
   - Encoded categorical variables (`key`, `mode`, `time_signature`)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations to examine correlation and distribution
   - Correlation heatmap for feature importance

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Used correlation analysis to identify key influencing features.
   - Removed multicollinear features using VIF.

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained and compared multiple regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - XGBoost Regressor

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used standard regression evaluation metrics:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - Coefficient of Determination \( R^2 \)

---

## 🧠 Models and Results

Each model was evaluated using:

\[
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
\]
\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]
\[
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
\]
\[
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
\]

**Best performing model:** `Random Forest Regressor`  
- High \( R^2 \) value (~0.89) indicating excellent prediction capability.
- Lower MAE and RMSE compared to other models.

## 📌 Conclusion

* Musical features like `energy`, `danceability`, `loudness`, and `valence` significantly affect a song’s popularity.
* Ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting outperform basic linear models.
* This model can be extended for real-world platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, etc., to forecast song performance.

---

## 📚 Future Work

* Incorporate lyrics or sentiment analysis
* Predict popularity over time (time series)
* Classify into popularity tiers (e.g., hit, average, flop)
